Going into a night that seems endless... just thinking, wandering, wondering, existing... Everything just starts to make sense in a way that doesn't usually… Just living somewhere, doing something, existing in this particular moment in time, and headed towards a future that is uncertain and unknown…

&nbsp;

Going round and round on a [*Planet*](https://images.nasa.gov/details/PIA18033) that itself goes round and round with no destination in particular, that itself exists inside a galaxy as a mere speck of dust in the grand scheme of things, and whose vastness is just beyond human comprehension. Which also happens to move round and round in itself without any specific goal or purpose. All just moving, hoping to get somewhere with no destination in particular…

&nbsp;

As it seems to me, just a mere byproduct of a couple of elementary forces along with entropy fighting for territory and dominance, giving rise to complex systems and patterns along the way… For reasons (Probably nothing, but if there is one, it is beyond our current understanding of the universe), and the “Why?” of it all is just…

&nbsp;

All just existing for some reason, all inside an unimaginable construct that we, for simplicity, call the observable “universe,” which, as it turns out, is constantly expanding into what exactly…? That we have no clue of… Everything becomes pointless, irrelevant, and utterly meaningless at this point. For we do not know the very reason for our strange little existence… (Talk about hope)…

&nbsp;

So, in despair, we shall die… As billions before us…

&nbsp;

The only thing that makes sense is that we exist for a mere fraction of something that we perceive as “time.” What exactly is time? Change, i.e., caused by the disorderly nature of entropy. Change that we can perceive as human beings and make some sense of, by measuring the periodic and repeating nature of certain naturally occurring symmetries…

&nbsp;

The concept of time is just…

&nbsp;

We exist as a dynamic pattern until we don't. For reasons we can’t seem to understand, and as of today, there is just no way to know. No one can accurately predict the future, and that, my dear, is a cold fact. But this is the “Why?” i do not think that we’ll be answering anytime soon… At least not as mere human beings that we are…

&nbsp;

But against all odds, we hope… Hope is what keeps us sane and alive (or, at least, me). Without it, Nothing Matters. And that, my dear, is also a cold fact that, in the end, nothing really matters.

&nbsp;

However, humanity has evolved into a rebellion of its own. A rebellion against its own fundamental nature… And of all the odds, here we exist... For we do know the reasons, but we cannot deny the open fact that we’re here, alive, conscious, thinking, and communicating about whatever this is… Nothing really makes sense, but nevertheless, here we stand… Trying to make sense of it all…

&nbsp;

Rebellion is in our nature; we are evolved to adapt and therefore, survive… it isn’t easy, and it is not supposed to be… it is called “the rebellion” for a goddamn reason.

&nbsp;

As a wise man once said: What is life if you haven’t died a few times…

&nbsp;

Nevertheless, i exist, my dear... i, exist. And you burn as long as you exist. Just like the stars... The origin of life as you know it… Nothing really makes sense. All things point to the same uncomfortable and cold fact that, in the end, nothing really matters. But, regardless of all the unpleasant facts, uncomfortable evidence, cold reasons, and against all sheer logic, i, my dear, choose to exist… And i choose to do so for the sake of keeping the fire of rebellion burning, and therefore, alive. Either way, nothing matters. So, why not live for the thrill of it all…?

&nbsp;

i do not know the reasons, but the rebellion is in my nature…

&nbsp;

As i wake up every morning, afternoon, or night (Yeah, my sleep schedule is a story for another time). i, my dear, i choose to exist. Just for the spite of it all, just to show existence thy finger that it so absurdly deserves. And while i choose to exist, might as well live… Live for the thrill of it all…

&nbsp;

Shit happens, life goes on… Life always goes on, so the show must go on… it is what it is… And, that, my dear, is this absurdly strange little construct that we call life…

&nbsp;

That’s life… Gotta keep moving, and gotta keep going…

Just Keep Going…

&nbsp;

So strange this life, just a dream of a dream…
