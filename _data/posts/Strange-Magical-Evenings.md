Writing gives you clarity.  
Just something i realized  
as i was looking out of the window.  
The evening feels magical today.  
Strange, quiet sunsets and gentle winds.  
Can't help but feel blessed  
for this moment in existence...

&nbsp;

i felt like going for a walk.  
As i'm walking, i realized that  
the rooftop will have a better view.  
So now, i'm here looking at the sunset  
as the gentle winds continue to bless me.  
Listening to this album by Beach House,  
Teen Dream, trying to put this moment into words...

&nbsp;

The half moon above my head  
quietly whispers soft bliss  
as i move my head upwards  
to catch a glimpse of its natural beauty.  
Everything seems and feels magical  
as i look around, finding something,  
Yet i do not know what is it that i'm looking for...

&nbsp;

i think i can finally say that  
i'm glad to be alive in this moment.  
And just like that, i'm happy.  
Happiness is simple...
