&nbsp;

You can  
Just learn things.

&nbsp;

Did you know that?

&nbsp;

No one  
knows everything.  
No one can.

&nbsp;

How could you?

&nbsp;

A very few  
think critically anymore.

&nbsp;

Everyone is biased  
to their own opinions.

&nbsp;

The problem  
gains momentum  
When we stop questioning  
the opinions we hold.

&nbsp;

We get used to talking  
in front of a wall,  
So all we can hear  
is ourselves.

&nbsp;

Try to put yourselves  
in others' shoes.

&nbsp;

Try to understand things  
from others' perspectives.

&nbsp;

Try to form  
a better understanding  
of the world you live in.

&nbsp;

Do not be a slave to  
your ignorant opinions.  
Question them.

&nbsp;

You are allowed to change  
As you learn more.

&nbsp;

You must try  
to get past your egos,  
to see the world  
beyond yourself.

&nbsp;

You'll find —  
There is a lot to discover  
in a lifetime,  
And there is a lot that  
stretches beyond your own.

&nbsp;

At first —  
it is unsettling  
And that's okay.

&nbsp;

Just keep going.

&nbsp;

Never —  
never stop  
questioning things.

&nbsp;

For it breaks the myths  
and only strengthens what is true.

&nbsp;

But only if you dare to question  
the nature of things.

&nbsp;

This is the way.  
This is the only way.

&nbsp;

Openness is intelligence  
in motion.  
Closed-mindedness is  
ignorance solidified.

&nbsp;

it is not easy.  
Nothing on this planet  
has ever been.

&nbsp;

The doubts and the questions  
exist to keep your opinions  
in check.

&nbsp;

As Richard Feynman  
Once said —  
Things must be learned,  
only to be unlearned again,  
or, more likely,  
to be corrected.

&nbsp;

Do not try  
to suppress them,  
For they are your guide.

&nbsp;

Change —  
is the only way forward.

&nbsp;

When faced with uncertainty,  
know that —  
Nothing is permanent.  
Everything changes.  
Nothing lasts forever.  
And life goes on.

&nbsp;

Remember —  
Acceptance is always  
the hardest part.

&nbsp;

Fix yourself  
before fixing the world.

&nbsp;

Trying is the most  
Human thing we can do.
