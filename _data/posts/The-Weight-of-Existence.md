&nbsp;

Have you ever danced so intensely

You started to cry beneath

the weight of it all...?

&nbsp;

i haven't.

i don't know if i can.

&nbsp;

i only saw someone —

And i almost cried with her.

&nbsp;

Unable to help

her or myself.

&nbsp;

Two beings,

two silences,

each breaking

beneath the weight

of their own...
