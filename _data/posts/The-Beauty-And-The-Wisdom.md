&emsp; Yeah, The Beauty & The Beast .) Anyway, you see, humans are evolved to appreciate beauty. And that, my dear friend (because i have none), is a cold fact. Beauty is just something we’re wired to be fond of and to get attracted to. And why wouldn’t we? it’s beautiful. That’s just human. We’re wired that way. Even i don’t appreciate ugliness in the world. Who does? it’s ugly. But listen, my dear friend, there are two kinds of ugliness in this world. One is aesthetic, and the second needs no definition. And that is the duality of existence…

&nbsp;

&emsp; There is “beautiful yet poisonous.” Yeah, you know what i’m talking about, like the beautiful flowers in the wild that you probably shouldn’t smell or touch. Don’t even think about eating it out .) But not all flowers are poisonous; most are genuinely beautiful and are a sight to admire. it is known; it is best to admire unfamiliar flowers from a distance .) Something to appreciate from afar…

&nbsp;

&emsp; There is “ugly yet essential.” Like algae, which contributes about 50-70% of the entire planet's oxygen supply. And yet, no one even cares about algae. Which is fine for algae because it doesn’t care either .) it doesn’t need anyone’s validation or gratitude; it will just do what it has always done, which is to produce oxygen and support the continuation of the dynamic pattern on the planet, i.e., what we call life on Earth. And therefore, making our very existence, as you know it, possible. in other words, “Wisdom is the ability to look beyond the aesthetics which often tries to mask its brilliance or danger.” For reasons only the almighty evolution knows…

&nbsp;

&emsp; And then, at last, there is this sheer ugliness in the world, moral ugliness, i.e., caused by human beings like you and me. it is not something that exists naturally; it is something that some sick people do. The ugliness of it is just the worst kind of ugliness there is in this life… These are the kinds of people who do ugly things in order to feel good about themselves, and i will never understand that. it’s just… Why? Why do people do this? Do they really feel good about themselves after hurting others? How could they? How does that even work? How do they live with themselves? All these wonderful things in this world for them to experience, and they want to experience what? The helplessness of others? The tears? The crying? The suffering of innocents? Death?

&nbsp;

&emsp; if you take pleasure in hurting innocent people, please do yourself, others, and the dynamic pattern on this planet a big favor and just erase yourself from existence, for you do not deserve to be in our shared human existence. There you go, is that the permission you’ve been looking for? Well, go ahead. This is the best advice anyone can ever give you. You’ll not be mourned, and you’ll finally bring some closure to the ones you hurt. This is the best you can do with your life, for you’re unable to bring joy and happiness into the world. All you do is hurt innocent people, leaving them thinking that there is something wrong with the world or themselves, and leaving them with traumatic memories that more often than not become their reason for choosing not to exist anymore. How is that fair?

&nbsp;

&emsp; No measure of good things done can cancel out the bad things you’ve done. Life isn’t some arithmetic operation; mathematics is all but a part of it. Wrong is just wrong. Each exists independent of the other, and you must bear the weight of your own actions. The good and the bad alike...

&nbsp;

&emsp; i’d rather cease to exist than to hurt an innocent human being. This is where i draw the line. This is where the line is. This is the line you must not cross. Do whatever you want, just don’t hurt innocent people. is this too much of an ask? See, i don’t think so.

&nbsp;

&emsp; The world is rather simple & fragile. Complexity exists, yes. We are complex creatures, yes. But the world is truly held together by the simplest of things. One needs love & care. Simple acts of kindness towards one another go a long way. At the end of the day, it is just people living their lives… And it is in the absence of simplicity that complexity emerges. The fragility emerges from the very fact that things are simple and therefore are easily exploited…

&nbsp;

&emsp; The simplicity isn’t a bug; it’s a feature. Life is rather simple: you are born, you live, and you die. That’s it. The dynamic pattern, i.e., the self-perpetuating cycle of life — organisms being born, existing, reproducing, and dying — persists as the system continues to thrive. One exists, but as a tiny part of a larger pattern, just like the cells in our bodies, which make our existence, as you know it, possible, and give rise to a larger, more complex pattern along the way. That’s life, and life goes on. Life always goes on…
