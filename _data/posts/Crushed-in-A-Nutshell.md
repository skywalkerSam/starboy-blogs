My first two crushes gave me  
Language & Computation.

&nbsp;

While i was lost  
learning & processing,  
The third one came along  
and showed me beauty —  
Like i was seeing it  
for the first time in my life...

&nbsp;

And then,  
The fourth one came along  
and offered me logic.  
i remember her saying,  
"Mathematics is just pure."

&nbsp;

i couldn't understand it then,  
For i was in too deep  
into the language,  
too obsessed with  
computation.  
And way too mesmerized by  
the sheer beauty of it all.  
But i do now...

&nbsp;

it is true —  
a big part of you  
remains undiscovered until,  
You meet a certain kind of person.

&nbsp;

And because —  
You never forget your first.  
The language is now  
a crucial part of me for ever.

&nbsp;

Lately, i've been realizing a lot…
