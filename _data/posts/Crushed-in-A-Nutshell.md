&nbsp;

My first two crushes gave me

Language & Computation.

&nbsp;

While i was lost

learning & processing,

The third one came along

showed me beauty —

Like i was seeing it

for the first time in my life...

&nbsp;

Then the fourth one came along

and offered me logic.

i remember her saying,

"Mathematics is just Pure."

&nbsp;

i couldn't understand it then.

because —

i was too deep into

the language,

too obsessed with

computation

And way too mesmerized by

the sheer beauty of it all.

&nbsp;

But i do now...

&nbsp;

it is true —

a big part of you

remains undiscovered

until —

You meet a certain kind of person.

&nbsp;

And because —

You never forget your first.

&nbsp;

The language is now

a crucial part of me for ever...

&nbsp;

Lately —

i've been realizing a lot...
