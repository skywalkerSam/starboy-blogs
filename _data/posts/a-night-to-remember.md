it was a strange night. Just walking down some street, appreciating the solitary nature of it all... Glimpsing at the stars... in my own little head, just wondering what it all means... Our lives... The strangely wild and absurd nature of our shared existence... Just wandering, wondering, and cherishing some of the nostalgic memories that i hold very dear in life... You know, the usual...

Yeah, might be a little drunk hence the aimless wandering in the night... Wrong place, wrong time, i guess... Something might've happened, i can't seem to remember exactly what... But, i know this: i am a very understanding human being. That is just my nature...

Anyway, i suddenly find myself on bare ground (i might've dosed off), i woke up and found myself hurting, someone was hitting me, i don't seem to remember why... he was blabbering something, and i was wondering just what in the hell am i doing on the ground getting beaten up by a total stranger... i mean, i'm all that, but i am a fighter too. i don't take shit from people. Yes, i have vowed to kill myself before hurting an innocent human being... i'm just lost... What the actual fuck is happening rn*?

He stops for some reason(probably tired). i get up, struggling to understand or stand for that matter... Still very confused, he's talking shit that i don't really understand... he looks at me, and stops talking. i read fear on his face as he looked up to me (i'm ~6'1", he measured up to my shoulder ~5''). i'm still wondering... What? Who? How? And, Why?

i have no clue, and i'm getting anxious and angry... i looked at him intensely, and i could suddenly feel all the rage from decades build up in my chest, my hands were clutching with pressure, my legs shivering as i walked up to him... he started to back down and fell, still backing down like a... i walk up to him, looking at his face... i can't explain the sudden darkness that i felt, but nevertheless, i was familiar with it...

it was an early and raw version of me that i buried a long time ago and thought that it was behind me... but, that day... it suddenly came alive... i felt his rage like a burning sun. i... i could feel the tears in his eyes, the tears of pure rage slowly rolling down thy eyes o' mine... i, stopped. i'm struggling to understand what i'm feeling rn*

Then suddenly, he throws a punch out of nowhere, and i'm struggling to understand what he just did... i looked at him with my raging set of eyes and said: "Be very careful now... if a monster is what you seek, you might just find one..."

He got up and started running... i'm just standing there struggling to understand what just happened... i find a nearby corner to sit, and here i am... talking to you, writing this... for reasons i do not understand just yet.

&nbsp;

What the fuck happened back there... i'm exhausted and will rest for now.

Until next time...✌️
