As i struggle to get on this overly crowded metro, the abstract symmetry of my entire existence flashes before my eyes, and i start to question the narrative of my strange little existence on this planet…

&nbsp;

i personally love the Blade Runner 2049 Soundtrack Album, and Interstellar sits right beside it. it's a vibe… Going into a night that seems endless, thinking, wandering, wondering, existing, everything starts to make sense in a way that doesn't usually. Just living somewhere, doing something, existing in this particular moment in time, and headed towards a future that is uncertain and unknown.

&nbsp;

Going round and round on a Planet that itself goes round and round, with no destination in particular. The planet itself exists inside a quiet region of our average galaxy that we call the Solar System, and there are many other systems like it. Our galaxy is so vast that we may never be able to explore it completely, even with lightspeed travel (which seems impossible, as of now\*), and even our galaxy is just one of the many others like it, which also happens to move round and round in itself without any specific goal or purpose. All just moving and moving, hoping to get somewhere with no destination in particular. Do you recognize the pattern? Just like us…

&nbsp;

Given the accelerated rate of expansion, most of the observable universe is already out of our reach, forever. We exist, but as a mere speck of dust on the cosmic scale of things, whose sheer vastness seems beyond human comprehension. There is a limit to what we can comprehend, and beyond those limits, numbers become meaningless. We say the words, but we can’t really comprehend their sheer abundance.

&nbsp;

As it seems to me, just a mere byproduct of a couple of elementary forces along with entropy fighting for territory, dominance, and disorder, giving rise to complex systems and patterns along the way, for reasons we do not yet understand, and the why of it all is just… Who knows?

&nbsp;

All just existing for some reason, all inside an unimaginable construct that we, for simplicity, call the “observable universe”/existence. Which, as it turns out, is constantly expanding into what exactly? That we have no clue of… What is the universe expanding into? What exists outside the “observable universe”? What lies beyond? There is just no way to know. The why of it all is just… i do not think that we’ll be answering these questions anytime soon. At least not as mere human beings that we are. Everything becomes pointless, irrelevant, and utterly meaningless at this point. it is all, but hypothetical. The ground fact is that “we are born, we live, and we die.” So, as it seems, in despair, we shall die… Just like the billions and billions before us.

&nbsp;

The only thing that makes sense is that we exist for a mere fraction of something that we perceive as “time.” What is the true nature of time? No one knows. But, as of now: Change, i.e., caused by the disorderly nature of entropy. Changes that we can perceive as human beings, and therefore, make some sense of, by measuring the periodic and repeating nature of certain naturally occurring symmetric phenomena. The future will always be uncertain and unknown. The concept of time is just… Who knows what the future holds?

&nbsp;

However, humanity has evolved into a rebellion of its own. A rebellion against its own fundamental nature. And against all odds, here we exist. The why isn’t clear, but we cannot deny the open fact that we’re here, alive, conscious, thinking, and communicating about whatever this is. Nothing matters, and nothing really makes sense, but nevertheless, here we stand, here we exist. Contemplating our very existence, and trying to make sense of it all… Rebellion is in our nature; we are evolved to learn, understand, adapt, and survive. The better we can understand the patterns that govern our existence, as you know it, the better the chances of our long-term survival. Rebellion, in other words, survival, is wired into our design. We exist to survive and to maintain the dynamic pattern on this planet. To keep the fire of civilization burning and alive. We exist, but as a dynamic pattern, until we don't. A dynamic pattern that consists of all things existing. And we’re all but a tiny part of it. Just like the cells in our bodies that make our existence possible. it isn’t easy, nor is it supposed to be. Nothing on this planet has ever been “easy.” Survival isn’t “easy.” For it is called “the rebellion” for a goddamn reason. And so, against all odds, we hope, and we survive. i do not have all the answers, but the rebellion is in my nature…

&nbsp;

Nevertheless, i exist, my dear... i, exist. And you burn as long as you exist. Just like the stars, the origin of life as you know it. All things point to the same cold, uncomfortable fact that in the end, nothing really matters. But, regardless of all the unpleasant facts, uncomfortable evidence, cold reasons, and against all odds and logic, i, my dear, choose to hope and exist. i choose to do so for the sake of keeping the fire of rebellion burning and alive. Either way, nothing matters. if there is no point in living, then there’s no point in dying either. i.e., called the duality of existence. So, why not live for the thrill of it all? Either way, inevitable is inevitable.

&nbsp;

As i wake up every morning, afternoon, or night (Yeah, my sleep schedule is a story for another day), i, my dear, i choose to exist. Just for spite of it all, just to show existence the finger it so absurdly deserves. And while i choose to exist, might as well live… Live for the thrill of it all.

&nbsp;

Shit happens, life goes on. Life always goes on. And so, the show must go on. it is what it is. That’s life. Gotta keep going, gotta keep moving. Just keep moving. Just keep going.

&nbsp;

it is in strange moments like these when the entire essence of existence comes alive. So strange this life, just a dream of a dream…
