&nbsp;

What to do in this life is just...  

Who knows what the future holds?  

Another day went by as i sit here wondering...

&nbsp;

At the end of the day, this is all you are –

An ordinary human.

Just as the billions before you who came to exist,

and the billions who are still yet to exist –  

Long after you've ceased to exist...  

Your memories become just another echo lost forever to the mists of time –  

Howling at the endless void of absolute nothingness,  

slowly fading away into that final good night...  

You cannot escape the simple fact that you're human –  

An ordinary human.

&nbsp;

We've been here, we'll be here again,

And again, and again, and again.  

That's how it goes...

Until the day we won't.

Even we wanted to...

That's life.  

Life goes on,  

Life always goes on...

&nbsp;

Stars will shine,  

Lights will glow,  

Time will pass,  

Nights will come,  

You'll fall asleep,  

and everything will be okay...
