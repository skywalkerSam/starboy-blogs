i see you, and i wish that i could help you, girl…

But i,

i wish i could make you smile,

Even for just a while…

i wish i could look into those tired set of eyes and say –

Hey\! i'm right here…

i wish i could hold your hand…

But i,

i wish i could be with you on those long & lonely nights…

i wish i could steal your sadness,

and bury it deep within…

i wish i could love you in a way that makes you feel whole again…

i wish i could just give you it all…

Yet i can’t.

For i am just a stranger passing by...

For it is in strange moments like these when the entire essence of existence comes alive...

Poetry is good.
