&nbsp;

i see you, and i wish that i could help you, girl… but i,

&nbsp;

i wish i could make you smile even for just a while…

&nbsp;

i wish i could look into those tired set of eyes and say... hey! i'm right here…

&nbsp;

i wish i could hold your hand… but i,

&nbsp;

i wish i could be with you on those long & lonely nights…

&nbsp;

i wish i could take your sadness, and bury it deep within…

&nbsp;

i wish i could love you in a way that makes you feel whole again…

&nbsp;

i wish i could just give you it all… but i can’t.

&nbsp;

For i am just a stranger passing by...

Poetry is good.

&nbsp;

For it is in strange moments like these when the entire essence of existence comes alive...

&nbsp;

Until Next Time... ✌️
