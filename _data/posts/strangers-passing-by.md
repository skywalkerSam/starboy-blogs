&nbsp;

i see you

And i wish that i could help you, girl…

But i,

&nbsp;

i wish i could make you smile

Even for just a while.

i wish i could look into

those tired set of eyes

and say –

Hey, i'm right here!

&nbsp;

i wish i could be with you

on those long & lonely nights.

i wish i could hold your hand

But i,

&nbsp;

i wish i could steal your sadness

and bury it deep within.

i wish i could love you in a way

which makes you feel whole again.

&nbsp;

i wish i could just give you it all

Yet, i can’t.

&nbsp;

For i am just a stranger passing by...

&nbsp;

–––

&nbsp;

For it is in strange moments like these when the entire essence of existence comes alive...

&nbsp;

Poetry is good.
