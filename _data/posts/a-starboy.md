Oh, the title Starboy... First of all, No* it isn't inspired by The Weeknd’s 2016 Album, Starboy (Although, it is a good album.)

The title "Starboy" originates from the mind of a little kid, i.e., me… As a kid, i used to be very excited about Space Exploration, Cosmos, and the future of Human Civilization as a whole. i was all about optimism and hope... And that is a good thing to see in a teenage kid. All that energy and excitement without the constant need for caffeine*

But sadly, life goes on... You live, you learn, you grow. That’s Life…

Even after all this time, i keep the title Starboy to remind me of that sweet, innocent little kid, even though now it seems a bit corny and is just cringe asf. At the time, i really believed that anything was possible(i kinda still do… You, in fact, can do anything, but you cannot do everything).

As i chose this title, what feels like ages ago, my heart was in the right place: We all are, in fact, Stardust. We really are... A star had to collapse in order to give life the elements it needs to emerge. We live in a universe where energy can't be created or destroyed. All energy is but borrowed.

So, in the end, the dynamic pattern, i.e., us, just dissolves into its simpler forms. Nothing really dies* And the pattern keeps repeating itself for reasons beyond our current understanding of the universe, and whatever tf lies beyond...

So, here i stand... a complicated collection of atoms that originated from a tiny region of a collapsing Star in a galaxy far, far away... And, traveled through a vast, hostile, lifeless, and utterly meaningless universe, and against all odds, here i fucking stand...

Contemplating my existence, asking questions, wandering and wondering about all there is in this absurdly strange little life...

&nbsp;

And after all, i am a boy, so there you go... "Starboy."
