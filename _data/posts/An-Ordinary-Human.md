&nbsp;

Who knows what the future holds?

&nbsp;

Another day went by as i

sit here wondering...

At the end of the day,

this is all you are —

An ordinary human.

&nbsp;

Just as the billions before you

who came to exist,

and the billions who are still

yet to exist —

Long after you've ceased to exist.

&nbsp;

Your memories become just another echo

lost forever to the mists of time —

Howling at the endless void

of absolute nothingness.

Slowly fading away into

that final good night...

&nbsp;

You cannot escape

a cruel fact that

you're human —

An ordinary human.

&nbsp;

We've been here,

We'll be here again,

and again, and again,

and again.

That's how it goes,

until the day it won't.

Even if you wanted it to...

&nbsp;

That's life.

Life goes on,

Life always goes on...

&nbsp;

Stars will shine,

lights will glow,

time will pass,

nights will come,

You'll fall asleep,

and everything will be okay...

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Look at me, comforting myself with words i'd like to hear...`
