"Arrogance is free, but wisdom demands reasoning, understanding, and acceptance after the fact." Just get started, and everything will fall into place.

&nbsp;

Nothing matures you more than someone making you move outta the house at a very young age, giving you a monthly allowance to survive, and leaving you all alone in this world to figure things out for yourself. What can i say? There's nothing left to say, i have no words. Right or wrong is a debate best left to the kids. it is what it is, and i am what i am because of it. Shit happens, life goes on...

&nbsp;

Nevertheless, if i ever decided to have kids, i would never abandon my kids like this, for it is inhumane, and it is a cruel thing to do. Kids think that they need money to buy more toys and chocolates, but that’s because they don’t know any better, and it is only later in life that they realize that they needed love more than anything. But now, that ship has long sailed. And now, all we're left with are these nostalgic memories of what once used to be, regrets, and quiet rage with nowhere to go…

&nbsp;

Oh, the overwhelming sense of urgency for no "real" reason, but to feel busy like the grown-ups .) it is only when you calm down for a moment, you start to realize certain things, i.e., there was no "real" reason to be in a constant state of urgency. We're no longer hunters and gatherers, so you should not be in a constant state of fight & flight. "Be calm, for it is in those quiet moments of silence where we find certain answers."

&nbsp;

Just wait until you've hit that sense of maturity about things in general, and now, you've gotta go back in time to remove or correct some of the things you had said carelessly, ignorantly, or just out of sheer arrogance at the time. i am only 21 years old, and i feel like i have lived a lifetime…

&nbsp;

it's ok, though. A part of growing up. Everything changes. Nothing lasts forever. Just keep going. Make mistakes, but please gather the courage to fix things when you later gain a better understanding of things.

&nbsp;

"Openness is intelligence in motion.  
Closed-mindedness is ignorance solidified."

&nbsp;

“We all have our biases, but we must try to evaluate things based on logic & reasoning. And be able to change our understanding of the world (perspective) based on the conclusions we reach, while still leaving room for uncertainty*"

&nbsp;

As Robert Frost once said, "The only way out is through." Running from oneself is futile. Escaping oneself is futile. You just can't. No one can. Sit down or lie down, and just have "the conversation", for it is the only way out.

&nbsp;

Remember — "Acceptance is always the hardest part." Nothing is ever as simple as it seems. Don't be arrogant, and always leave room for uncertainty. Nothing is ever finished, no feeling is final. There's always the unexpected, and therefore, the room to grow. it is not ideal to make others pay for your petty little insecurities. “Fix yourself before fixing the world.” We can live in a world that we design.

&nbsp;

i see someone struggling like i was at the time, and i ask myself what would i say to myself back then? And this is what i've come up with. But unfortunately, you can't just go and say this to someone. i know this because i wouldn't have listened anyway .(

&nbsp;

Life, eh? What can you do? Oh, the almighty despair… So, as it seems, in despair, we shall die…

Just be honest, and everything will fall into place. Honesty is quite an addictive drug; once you try it, you're hooked .)
