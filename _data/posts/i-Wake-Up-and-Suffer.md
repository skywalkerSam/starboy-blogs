Story of my life...

&nbsp;

One day i wake up

And everything feels fine.

&nbsp;

Another day i wake up

And everything is fucked.

&nbsp;

Some days i wake up

And i'm happy for no reason.

&nbsp;

Today i woke up

And i am just sad.

&nbsp;

That's just how it goes.

And tomorrow —

Who knows?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Sadness is just another state of mind...
