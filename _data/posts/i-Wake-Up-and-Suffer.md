**Story of my life...**

&nbsp;

One day i wake up,  
and everything feels fine.  
Another day comes up,  
and everything seems fucked.  
Some days i wake up,  
and i'm happy for no reason.  
Today i got up,  
and i’m just sad.  
That's just how it goes,  
and tomorrow —  
Who knows?  

&nbsp;

Playing emotional roulette as it seems, as if i wake up just to suffer. Nevertheless, sadness is just another state of mind, and just like everything else in life, it’ll pass too. Nothing lasts forever.
