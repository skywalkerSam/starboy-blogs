&nbsp;

i can't help but

suddenly i feel like

i'm existing

at the edge

of some strange

apocalypse

or something.

&nbsp;

Wherever i look

all i can see is —

The sheer

strangeness

of the moment

in existence.

&nbsp;

Oh,

the sudden urge

to just

cease to exist

in the moment.

&nbsp;

The sheer

strangeness

of it all —

Life at its strangest.

&nbsp;

i've been reasoning

with —

The inevitable

void of

absolute nothingness

since 12021.

&nbsp;

i don't think that

i can escape this —

No one can.

&nbsp;

You can't escape

the simple fact

that —

You're an

ordinary

human being.

Everyone is.

&nbsp;

You can't escape reality.

&nbsp;

Eventually —

Everything

comes to an end.

&nbsp;

Everyone dies.

Nothing lasts forever.

&nbsp;

On some strange days

i can feel the abyss

creeping in.

&nbsp;

it unsettles me.

For i have

no answers

to why

it itself

even exists

in the first place.

&nbsp;

The dreams

are not what they

used to be —

They've become

stranger than ever.

&nbsp;

All i dream is the void

slowly closing in.

&nbsp;

it scares me.

&nbsp;

Sometimes —

i'd catch a glimpse.

&nbsp;

i'd sit there

trying to put

all the pieces

together,

trying to

make sense

of it all,

and it doesn't.

&nbsp;

Nothing makes sense,

and it unsettles me.

&nbsp;

i've accepted this —

You can't fight the inevitable.

&nbsp;

But like i said —

Acceptance

is always

the hardest part.

&nbsp;

in the end —

Nothing matters.

&nbsp;

And yet —

We exist.

&nbsp;

As simple as that,

and as complicated as that.

&nbsp;

Life goes on…
