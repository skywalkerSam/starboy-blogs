Astronaut Edward H. White II, pilot for the Gemini-Titan 4 (GT-4) spaceflight, floats in the zero-gravity of space during the third revolution of the GT-4 spacecraft.

&nbsp;

He died in the Apollo fire, but he was the kind of man who truly lived. This banger of a picture right here, gentlemen... it captures the very essence of it… Of what it means to be alive…

&nbsp;

Whenever i see certain photographs or paintings, this is the question that just keeps going round and round in my head: “Do You Understand What They’re Trying to Capture…?” My brain starts to go nuts. My imagination is running wild… it gets out of hand real soon. The glimpses of strange and unknown places, and what does it mean to exist in such a strange world… Like i said: i go nuts.

&nbsp;

Every once in a while, i visit [*images.nasa.gov*](https://images.nasa.gov) for fun... Recently, i came across this *Pre-Apollo* image of "Edward H. White II" while i was reliving the year 1969 (especially July 16-24).

&nbsp;

A fun fact: My birthday comes on the 21st of July. Yeah, missed it by a day, but it’s not about that. Hell, i missed it by being born 36 years later. But often i go down there to see some of the pictures of our shared existence. Can you imagine the sheer amount of courage that it took to do such a thing…? Going into space… it’s uncharted territory. Stranger than the still familiar ocean. Especially, if you can comprehend the fact that it was all based on theories and calculations done on pieces of paper. Death was certainly the possibility, but as a wise man once said: What’s life if you haven’t died a few times…? Everything extraordinary exists on the other side of fear… So, away we went… Strapped to a giant [*rocket*](https://images.nasa.gov/details/S73-26912) ship, away we went… Whatever the political situation might be at the time, you can’t deny the astonishing progress we’ve made in the field of Space Exploration, and our understanding of the [*universe*](https://images.nasa.gov/details/hubble-peeks-at-a-spiral-galaxy_18961260104_o)...

“One small [*step*](https://images.nasa.gov/details/6900947) for [*man*](https://images.nasa.gov/details/6903870), a giant [*leap*](https://images.nasa.gov/details/6900994) for [*mankind*](https://images.nasa.gov/details/68p-416).”

&nbsp;

Going to the moon, literally! What an exciting time to be alive… Scary, but exciting nonetheless. Here’s a classic from Frank Sinatra: [*Fly Me To The Moon…*](https://open.spotify.com/track/7FXj7Qg3YorUxdrzvrcY25?si=32ece20e1eb34893)

&nbsp;

Try to imagine being on the surface of the moon, you look around, there’s nothingness… No sign of life, and darkness as far as the eyes can see… A naked view of the world beyond… And then there’s [*this*](https://images.nasa.gov/details/as11-44-6551)... Everything you’ve ever known, everyone who has ever lived, the essence of the entire human civilization… Right here, and you’re looking at it… Wondering and struggling to comprehend the sheer strangeness of it all… it is in the moments like these when the entire essence of [*existence*](https://images.nasa.gov/details/GSFC_20171208_Archive_e001651) comes alive…
