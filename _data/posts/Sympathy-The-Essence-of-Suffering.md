&nbsp;

if your actions are hurting people,  
and you're too stupid to see,  
As you choose to remain ignorant,  
and a slave to your ignorant opinions.

&nbsp;

You do not deserve my empathy.  
Even though being as  
sympathetic creatures as we are —  
We just can't help but feel sorry for you.

&nbsp;

And then, hating ourselves for feeling  
something as pure as sympathy...

&nbsp;

What a wonderful world\!

&nbsp;

i have no words.

&nbsp;

So,  
as it seems,  
in despair, we shall die...

&nbsp;

Do whatever you want,  
Just don't hurt anyone.

&nbsp;

is that really too much to ask...?

&nbsp;

Things have a way of circling back.

&nbsp;

What goes around comes around.  
And round,  
and round,  
And round, we go...

&nbsp;
