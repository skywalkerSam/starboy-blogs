There will always be a war somewhere to fight because most humans are arrogant and therefore ignorant. Not willing to understand the true nature of things, but delusional enough to try to project their delusions onto the simple nature of things.

&nbsp;

in a world where we need modern solutions to problems, there are people out there trying to invent a "time machine" to turn back the clock and send us all back to the dark ages of woods & caves. All of this, just because they are afraid of change, which is inevitable. And the petty insecurities that come with it.

&nbsp;

While the answer is rather simple: "Change is the essence of existence." Without change, nothing ever happens. You & i wouldn't be having this conversation. Without entropy, nothing would exist. Change is the only way forward. Everything grows, everything changes. Nothing lasts forever. Accept the change and adapt. Learn & grow. That is what we're evolved to do. We're human beings. Resisting change is futile, and it only leads to the possibility of extinction.

&nbsp;

Everything that you can see exists. Whether you acknowledge it or not. Existence doesn't need external validation. it exists regardless of the opinions of you and i. it is our job to recognize the patterns and reach the right conclusions. Understanding is the only way forward.

&nbsp;

There is a lot that you cannot see because of our shared biological limitation, which also exists. Life is not just black & white. There are 16.7M colors that form the visual world for you to see. Your biology can only translate \~10M of them. And there's much, much more that exists, and is hidden in those quiet and intense bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.

&nbsp;

There is always much, much more to anything than what meets the eye. Remember that. There is always some room to grow. No one knows everything. How could you?

&nbsp;

Answers are simple, and yet the journey to get there is much more complicated than someone shouting about things they don't really seem to understand. And in some cases, incomprehensible. Even for people who are trying to unify all the partial theories into a Complete Theory of Everything that describes the universe and our existence within it. Sometimes, even losing themselves over to a paradox the theory itself presents: if there really is a complete unified theory, it also means that it constitutes "everything." Even our very actions. So, the theory itself would determine the outcome of our search for it. Nevertheless, we're doing our best — trying to make some sense of it. Trying to understand. Meanwhile, all some group of arrogant people are doing is hurting innocent people who did nothing wrong and are just living their lives, because someone is too delusional to question their arrogance and their ignorant opinions of things they do not wish to understand.

&nbsp;

if that someone is you, please listen to me: Do not be a slave to your ignorant opinions. Question them. For it breaks the egos & arrogance, and only strengthens what is true. Do not suppress the questions and the doubts. For they exist to keep your opinions in check and your understanding of the world up to date. Keep learning, keep growing. You are allowed to change as you learn more. That is called being human. We learn, and we adapt. This is the very essence of what it means to be human – Trying.

&nbsp;

No human being is "stupid." You’ve just stopped learning and, therefore, closing yourselves off to new ideas. You just need to get past your ego to see the world beyond yourself.

&nbsp;

Openness is intelligence in motion. Closed-mindedness is ignorance solidified.

&nbsp;

You were born, and you will die. That's life. Accept that. And let's make life on this planet beautiful for all things existing.  
And that is my delusion — hope.

&nbsp;

The reality is that no one cares enough to listen. To just stop for a moment and be willing to question the narrative and themselves. Men in their arrogance, willing to fix everything but themselves.

&nbsp;

i have no words, for i have no answers. it is only by our shared collective understanding of the world we live in can we truly make some real progress towards the version of the world that is beautiful for all things existing. Not just for some, but for all humankind in existence. Actions are harder than words, yes.

&nbsp;

i can't fix the world. For i only have two hands. it all depends on the will of the many, and as most humans choose to remain arrogant and therefore, ignorant. So, as it seems, in despair, we shall die...

&nbsp;

The least you can do is try not to be a part of the problem.

&nbsp;

Life goes on,

&nbsp;

i try to understand people regardless of how loudly their ego and insecurities scream. However annoying they seem to be, i try... Until i don't, i nod and simply walk away. Peace of mind above everything else.

&nbsp;

i'm just an ordinary human being like you. Please do not forget: Trying is a choice. Understanding is a choice. Fix yourself before fixing the world.

&nbsp;

if your actions are hurting people,  
and you're too arrogant to see,  
As you choose to remain arrogant,  
and a slave to your ignorant opinions.

&nbsp;

You do not deserve my empathy.  
Even though being as  
sympathetic creatures as we are —  
We just can't help but feel sorry for you.

&nbsp;

And then, hating ourselves for feeling  
something as pure as sympathy...

&nbsp;

What a wonderful world\!

Remember — The future generations will be smarter than us, with more of our strength and fewer of our weaknesses. And you'll be judged. Your arrogance will be judged. if all you did was to give in to your ego and insecurities, and hurt innocent people because of it, that would look good. Your arrogance will be a stain on your memory. And even your own sons & daughters, and then their sons & daughters will feel ashamed being called out your name as their father or mother or grandfather or grandmother or whatever. That's how histories work. They judge our actions and determine how we will be remembered, and if at all. And there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it, except to realise this shortcoming now and work on yourself. it is never too late to do the right thing. You are allowed to change as you learn more. That is called being human. Mistakes are inevitable; the ability to rectify those mistakes is where we shine because we try. Trying is the very essence of being human. Trying to fix what's broken. Trying to fix yourself. Trying to do better each time. Trying to be better than you were yesterday, every day. Trying to make this planet beautiful for all things existing. This is the essence of existing. This is the essence of being.

&nbsp;

in time, everything will eventually cease to exist. But that is on the timescale of the universe. As humans, we don't live that long. We're just a mere blip inside a dynamic pattern that exists on this planet. An ordinary human. Nothing more, nothing less. Everything is subject to change. Even this, as we learn more about the universe and our existence within it. But for now, this is what we have to work with. Nothing matters, and yet, here we exist. As simple as that, and as complicated as that. So, as long as we're here existing, might as well make the best of it; learn, adapt, grow, try to understand, be happy, and try to put a smile on whoever happens to wander around your gravity of being. What else is there in this life...?

&nbsp;

So, sleep tight. The truth always prevails because it doesn't need external validation. But arrogance and ego can't exist without external validation. And because everyone dies, and nothing lasts forever. So, at the end of the day, the truth is the only thing that remains. Even after you're long gone. The idea of you continues to exist inside the memories of the ones you happen to be a source of light in this inevitable void of absolute nothingness. The inevitable is inevitable. You can't fight the inevitable. No one can. Acceptance is always the hardest part.

&nbsp;

Fix yourself before fixing the world.

&nbsp;

Existence is punishment enough.

Stars will shine,  
lights will glow,  
time will pass,  
nights will come,  
You'll fall asleep,  
and everything will be okay...
