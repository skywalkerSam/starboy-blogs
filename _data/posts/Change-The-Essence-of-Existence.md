"So, you think you know me?

&nbsp;

Trust me when i say this —

At times, i don't even know me.

&nbsp;

And that is the essence of living:

to live,

to discover,

to learn,

to grow,

to change.

&nbsp;

Nothing lasts forever.

Everything changes.

&nbsp;

This is my life —

i am the one

who defines the narrative."
