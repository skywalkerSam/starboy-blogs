Poetry saved me...

&nbsp;

Poetry heals

what is broken.

&nbsp;

it gives you spaces —

to breathe,

to feel,

to be.

&nbsp;

it carves out the

spaces within silences

in which the depth can exist.

&nbsp;

it is simple —

either you get it,

or you don't.

&nbsp;

Life goes on.

Poetry is good.
