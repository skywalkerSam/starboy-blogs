&emsp; Oh, the hope for a better future… Everyone needs it, but very few try to think critically about it. The definition of "better" is particularly a tricky one. Better for whom? Just for you? Your family? Your tribe? Or, the Human Civilization? The context matters. Without gathering a deeper insight into the diversity that exists on our planet today, it is all but meaningless. it becomes just another shallow promise that people often make, without ever really meaning a word of it. And on the surface, it seems a very innocent one, too. But what if they actually meant – “Making the world a better place” for themselves? Without ever caring about the cost for others in our shared existence?

&nbsp;

&emsp; The system suffers, for it consists of the human civilization as a whole. When you say “Civilization”, what you should ideally mean is the people it consists of. Civilization doesn’t exist in an abstract space; it consists of people like you and me. And if you don’t actually mean that, i have no words for such shallowness. Companies and giant corporations say things like this for good PR, but all they really care about is maximizing profit margins at all costs. The aftermath – The dynamic pattern on this planet is threatened…

&nbsp;

&emsp; A man came along with such a promise and motivated millions of people around the globe with his shallow promises. Looking back now, it might’ve been just shallow words. And it is only in the last couple of years that we are starting to see through the sheer shallowness by carefully examining their actions against their hypothetical idea of making the world “a better place.” Yeah, i was one of the victims too. Silly me\!

&nbsp;

&emsp; Science tells us that everything is provisional, i.e., subject to change. Change is the only thing that’s constant in this absurdly strange little life, for change is the very essence of existence. in other words, entropy. Every theory is actually a hypothesis that holds until it doesn’t. And then, new theories come along, or the previous one is corrected in order to agree with the outcome of the experiment. in other words, trust the scientific method. As Richard Feynman once said, "in science, experiment is the sole judge of the scientific truth."

&nbsp;

&emsp; it is sad to see such shallowness masquerading as "making the world a better place", while the suffering of others is right in front of their eyes. All they do is try their best to ignore the uncomfortable and defend their proven-wrong ideologies or hypotheses out of sheer self-importance and arrogance. While defending may seem easier than questioning, this is not the way…

&nbsp;

&emsp; Even the greatest of physicists who pioneered the way for modern physics as we know it today, fell for the fundamental human psychology trap. That’s just human – Newton & Einstein, both victims of their own brilliance. Newton theorized the laws of motion along with the force of gravity, but refused to accept the lack of absolute space implied by his very own laws because of his idea of an absolute god. On the other hand, Einstein theorized the Special Theory of Relativity (e=mc^2), in other words, mass-energy equivalence. And then to address the gravitational anomalies with the theory, he came up with the General Theory of Relativity which introduced and revolutionized our understanding of space-time continuum and gravity, explaining the deflection of light around massive objects, the redshift of light, the existence of gravitational waves to time dilation and the expansion of the universe, but refused to accept the quantum world it revealed, saying "God doesn't play dice." Although his contribution was phenomenal, given his refusal to accept the quantum theories, the physics community moved beyond him, even without his blessing. it indeed is a sad sight to witness… Acceptance is always the hardest part. But unfortunately, science doesn't care about anyone's opinions. Either you accept it, or you don't. it will continue to exist either way. Life goes on…

&nbsp;

&emsp; We all have our biases, but we must try to evaluate things based on logic & reasoning. And should be able to change our stance based on the conclusions we reach, while still leaving room for uncertainty\*

&nbsp;

&emsp; Arrogance is free, but wisdom demands reasoning, understanding, and acceptance after the fact…

&nbsp;

Remember –  
“Openness is intelligence in motion,  
Closed-mindedness is ignorance solidified...”
