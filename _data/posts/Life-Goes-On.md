What to do in this life is just…

&nbsp;

i know these things

may be all too well.

The answers are simple,

but like i said —

Acceptance is the hardest part.

i could tell you,

but you won't understand anyway.

So, as it seems —

in despair, we shall die...

&nbsp;

Life is — at its best,

sad beyond comprehension.

i have no idea why i write,

i don't even try to.

i just don't know what else to do

with what i've learned.

And, so the words start flowing...

&nbsp;

Sometimes, i can't help it.

&nbsp;

Life is — at its core

from its origins to the end

incomprehensibly absurd.

&nbsp;

Nevertheless –

i choose just keep going

for some reason.

Even though all i find is —

The almighty suffering & despair.

&nbsp;

Just trying to make some sense of it

having realized a long ago —

There wasn't any to begin with.

There is nothing but

silence waiting at the end.

&nbsp;

So, in despair, we shall die...

&nbsp;

We all live in our own little hells

hells of our own making.

Life is suffering

and suffering is inevitable.

To exist is to suffer —

So just be sure to find

something worth suffering for...

&nbsp;

Life Goes On,
