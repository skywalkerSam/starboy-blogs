Oh, the title Starboy... First of all, No\* it isn't inspired by The Weeknd’s 2016 Album, Starboy (Although, it is a good album.)

&nbsp;

The title "Starboy" originates from the mind of a little kid, i.e., me… As a kid, i used to be very excited about Space Exploration, Cosmos, and the future of Human Civilization as a whole. i was all about optimism and hope... And that is a good thing to see in a teenage kid. All that energy and excitement without the constant need for caffeine\*

&nbsp;

But sadly, life goes on... You live, you learn, you grow. That’s Life…

&nbsp;

Even after all this time, i keep the title Starboy to remind me of that sweet, innocent little kid, even though now it seems a bit corny and is just cringe asf. At the time, i really believed that anything was possible(i kinda still do… You, in fact, can do anything, but you cannot do everything).

&nbsp;

As i chose this title, what feels like ages ago, my heart was in the right place: We all are, in fact, Stardust. We really are... A star had to collapse in order to give life the elements it needs to emerge. We live in a universe where energy can't be created or destroyed. All energy is but borrowed.

&nbsp;

So, in the end, the dynamic pattern, i.e., us, just dissolves into its simpler forms. Nothing really dies\* And the pattern keeps repeating itself for reasons beyond our current understanding of the universe, and whatever tf lies beyond...

&nbsp;

So, here i stand... a complicated collection of atoms that originated from a tiny region of a collapsing Star in a galaxy far, far away... And, traveled through a vast, hostile, lifeless, and utterly meaningless universe, and against all odds, here i fucking stand...

&nbsp;

Contemplating my existence, asking questions, wandering and wondering about all there is in this absurdly strange little life...

&nbsp;

And after all, i am a boy, so there you go... "Starboy".
