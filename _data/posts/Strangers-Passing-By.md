i see you,  
and i wish that i could help you, girl  
but i,  
i wish i could make you smile,  
even for just a while.  
i wish i could look into  
those tired set of eyes, and say –  
Hey, i'm right here!  

&nbsp;

i wish i could be with you  
on those long & lonely nights.  
i wish i could hold your hand,  
but i,  
i wish i could steal your sadness  
and bury it deep within.  
i wish i could love you in a way  
that makes you feel whole again.  
i wish i could just give you it all,  
yet i can’t.  

&nbsp;

For i am just a stranger passing by…

Just hoping to somehow freeze the moment and spend an eternity lost inside those melancholic set of eyes, but it passes, as all things do. Nothing lasts forever. Oh, the sudden urge to just cease to exist in the moment, never to be found again. So, as it seems, in despair, we shall die…

&nbsp;

Life goes on,
