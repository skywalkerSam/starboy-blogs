As humans,  
it is in our nature  
to force our arrogance  
upon the simple nature of things.  

&nbsp;

Once upon a time,  
it used to be a necessity  
for our survival.  
But nowadays,  
We do not live in woods & caves.  

&nbsp;

We do it simply because we can.  
Because we feel like it.  
Regardless of the consequences  
to others in our shared existence.  

&nbsp;

Mortal men,  
at the end of their line,  
trying to play god,  
ignorant of the simple fact:  
There is no god.  
Everyone dies.  

&nbsp;

Eventually —  
Everything comes to an end.  
There is no point —  
We just do things to survive.  
in the meanwhile,  
We exist.  

&nbsp;

All ignorant of the simple beauty  
of a flower's existence on a tree...
