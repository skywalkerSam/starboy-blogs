As humans,  
it is in our nature  
to force our ignorant will  
upon the simple nature of things.

&nbsp;

Once upon a time —  
it used to be a necessity  
for our survival.

&nbsp;

But nowadays —  
We do not live in woods & caves.

&nbsp;

We do it simply because we can —  
because we feel like it.

&nbsp;

Regardless of the consequences  
to others in our shared existence.

&nbsp;

Mortal men —  
At the end of their line,  
trying to play god,  
ignorant of the simple fact:  
There is no god.

&nbsp;

Everyone dies.

&nbsp;

Eventually —  
Everything comes to an end.

&nbsp;

There is no point —  
We just do things to survive.

&nbsp;

All ignorant of the simple beauty  
of a flower's existence on a tree...

&nbsp;
