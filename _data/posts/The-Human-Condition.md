Blinded by hatred, arrogance, disbelief due to ignorance of the open facts, the inability to reason, the unwillingness to accept change, and the simple fact that "Everything Changes."

&nbsp;

Things do not tend to stay still on this planet or anywhere else in our shared observable universe, for entropy is the very cause of our very existence. Nothing lasts forever. Nothing can. Everything changes. That is the flow of life. That is the dynamic pattern that exists and constitutes all things existing.

&nbsp;

All we can do is learn, adapt, understand, and try to move forward while accepting the things that are beyond an ordinary human's control. All for the love of a better tomorrow for all humankind.

&nbsp;

And the sad part is that you won't even try to understand this if you have no idea about what i'm trying to say, because we're all but creatures of simple nature who avoid complicated reasoning with a short attention span. Or, maybe i should do a better job at conveying the ideas, but i too have a limited amount of time, and i have my own set of problems to deal with, regardless of the fact that the word is literally in shambles. i exist at a rather stable place, stable than most, but that doesn't change the fact that there's a whole other world existing outside the comfort of my home. And that this planet is just another flicker in existence on the cosmic scale that stretches far beyond our human comprehension, and there are a lot of questions to answer about our shared existence on this planet if we're ever successful in resolving the petty hatred for one another, and creating a world where critical reasoning and understanding are allowed to flourish. But the current geopolitical landscape is getting more and more ridiculous, anything but far from the idea of a planet for one species united together to build a better future, and to theorize the equations that govern our existence, as you know it. All for the love of a better future for generations to come.

&nbsp;

But, the dream seems far and farther away since most of the population is struggling to meet their basic needs in order to survive and flourish. Our leaders forget that "At the end of the day, it is just people living their lives." They forget their duty towards their fellow human beings and become arrogant. And then, there are leaders who will fail to comprehend this piece, and won't even try to because they think that they know everything. But the sad fact is that no one knows everything. No one can. This is all, but a mere abstraction of the problems existing in our world today.

&nbsp;

And, i'm exhausted .(
