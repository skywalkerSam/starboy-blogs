&nbsp;

Blinded by hatred and arrogance, ignorant of the open facts, the inability to reason critically, the unwillingness to accept change, and the simple fact that everything changes and nothing lasts forever…

&nbsp;

&emsp; Things do not tend to stay still on this planet or anywhere else in our shared observable universe, for entropy is the very cause of our existence. Everything changes, and that is the flow of life. Change is the very essence of existence. Oh, the dynamic pattern…

&nbsp;

&emsp; All one can do is learn, adapt, try to understand, and move forward while accepting the things that are beyond one’s control. All for the love of a better tomorrow for all humankind…

&nbsp;

&emsp; The sad part is that you won't even try to understand this if you have no idea about what i'm trying to say, and i don’t even blame you. Because what are we if not complex creatures of simple nature who avoid complicated reasoning, for evolution gave us a short attention span, for the very fact that “Shit happens, and life goes on.” Or, maybe i should do a better job at conveying these ideas…

&nbsp;

&emsp; But i, too, have a limited amount of time, just like everyone else on this strange little planet. i have my own set of problems to deal with in order to preserve my existence and survive, even though the world is literally in shambles right now…

&nbsp;

&emsp; The current geopolitical landscape is getting more and more ridiculous day by day; it is heading anywhere but very far from the idea of an ideal planet for one species united together against the cosmic insignificance and the inevitable void of absolute nothingness…

&nbsp;

&emsp; i just happen to exist in a rather stable environment, stable than most anyway, but that doesn't change the fact that there's a whole world out there existing outside the comfort of my home. That this planet is just another flicker in existence on the cosmic scale that stretches far beyond an ordinary human’s lifespan…

&nbsp;

&emsp; There are a lot of questions awaiting explanation about our absurdly strange little existence on this strange little planet. if we're ever successful in resolving our petty little hatred for one another, and creating a world where critical reasoning and understanding are allowed to flourish. To build a better future for all humankind, and to theorize the equations that govern our existence, as you know it – The theory of everything (whatever that may mean). All for the love of a better future for generations to come…

&nbsp;

&emsp; The ideal seems farther and farther away since most of the population on the planet is struggling to meet the basic needs in order to survive and flourish. Our leaders keep forgetting that "At the end of the day, it is just simply people living their lives." They forget their duty towards their own people, never you mind the fellow humans, and become arrogant, selfish, and greedy AF. More often than not, they lose their ability to reason critically, especially what is best for their citizens, never you mind the rest of the world. Oh, the imaginary lines we draw on the planet to…

&nbsp;

&emsp; And then, this piece – This is all i have. This is all, but a mere abstraction of the problems existing on our strange little planet that we call our home…

&nbsp;

&emsp; And so, i leave you with this: “Fix yourself before fixing the world…”
