"The Duality of Existence."

&nbsp;

"if two people have an understanding, everything else is just noise." And vice versa, it goes both ways; if you have all the favorable conditions, and yet, if they lack the underlying understanding, the noise will eventually win. For the entropy of a closed system always increases. The bond needs to be like rubber; under intense pressure, it crystallizes. But do keep in mind, rubber is flexible, not indestructible. Nothing is. There is a threshold, a breaking point, to every material's structure that you must not cross. "You can't force understanding." Whether it exists or it doesn't. it has to come naturally through learning and lived experiences. Just like a cocoon is an early stage of a butterfly, everything grows. Everything evolves. it just takes time. We're humans, not mere structures. We inhabit multiple structures (Yes, even rubber). We learn, we adapt, we understand, we change, and we evolve. Oh, and by the way, no. i'm not talking about that rubber bag .)

“if there is no point in living,  
Then there’s no point in dying either .)  
As i said,  
The duality of existence.  
Either way, life goes on.  
Life always goes on.”

"As artists,  
we reach for something.  
We try to create something  
more than ourselves.  
Something bigger than ourselves.  
Creations are symbiotic in nature;  
We shape it as much as it shapes us.  
We do not hold it —  
it holds us."
