Confidence & Arrogance  
Knowing & Understanding  
Understanding & Acceptance  
Reasons & Necessity  
Wish & The Will  
Hope & Despair  
Despair & Optimism  
Living & Existing  
You & Your Existence  
Existence & the essence of it  
Love & the idea of it  
Life & Your interpretation of it.”

“if there is no point in living,  
Then there’s no point in dying either .)  
As i said,  
The duality of existence.

&nbsp;

Either way, life goes on.  
Life always goes on.”

"As artists,  
We always try to create  
something more than ourselves,  
something bigger than ourselves.

&nbsp;

Creations are symbiotic in nature.  
We shape it as much as it shapes us.  
We do not hold it —  
it holds us. "
